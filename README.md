# TamDEM-R
R interface for downloading TamDEM-X data.
Information on the data can be found at [DLR's geoservice](https://geoservice.dlr.de/web/dataguide/tdm90/ "geoservice.dlr.de").

CAUTION: There is a huge gap of data in the European Alps. (Which is the I am most interested in)
Thus I did not further developed the package.
